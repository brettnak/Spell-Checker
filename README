I chose to write this program in ruby because I'm the most familiar with ruby.

This program runs on ruby 1.9.2, it probably runs on earlier versions but it 
was not tested. If you would like to run the specs, please install the rspec
gem:
    gem install rspec

My installation is through RVM and has irb installed by default.  If you run
the program and you see errors for readline or optparse, please install them
through the gem manager.  I beleive they are included but if they are not
installed on your machine by default, please run:
    gem install readline optparse
